Capcom has unveiled an intriguing glimpse into its upcoming title, Pragmata, showcasing a unique blend of puzzle-solving and shooting mechanics that promises to redefine gameplay in the sci-fi genre. The recent gameplay reveal highlights players' ability to hack robots through a mini-game while simultaneously engaging in combat, creating a dynamic and immersive experience that keeps players on their toes.

Set in a near-future lunar research station facing a crisis, players will step into the shoes of Hugh, a combat-ready spaceman, alongside his android companion, Diana. This unusual pairing not only adds depth to the narrative but also raises questions about the gameplay's longevity and how these mechanics will evolve over a potentially expansive experience. With Capcom's strong track record in game development, there’s a palpable excitement surrounding how these innovative ideas will manifest in the final product.

As we await the game's release in 2026, the anticipation builds—will Pragmata successfully merge its puzzle and shooting elements into a cohesive and captivating adventure? Only time will tell, but the initial impressions certainly leave us eager for more.
