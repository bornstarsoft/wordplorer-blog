Square Enix has officially announced that Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade will be the largest game on the Nintendo Switch 2, with a staggering file size of up to 99GB. This means that installing the game could consume nearly 40% of the console's available storage, which is a significant consideration for gamers looking to maximize their library on the new platform. The Standard Edition will require between 90GB and 95GB, while the Limited Editions will push that number even higher.

In comparison, other AAA titles on the Switch 2 have managed to maintain much smaller file sizes, with games like Hogwarts Legacy clocking in at around 23GB and Cyberpunk 2077 at 57GB. The sheer size of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade raises questions about storage management for players and the technical challenges of porting such a visually demanding game to a handheld console. Director Naoki Hamaguchi emphasized the importance of maintaining high-quality lighting to ensure the game does not lose its visual appeal, even at a lower frame rate of 30fps on the Switch 2.

As we approach the game's release on January 22, the gaming community is left wondering how this ambitious port will perform and whether it will set a new standard for future titles on the Nintendo Switch 2. Will players be willing to sacrifice storage space for a premium gaming experience? Only time will tell.
