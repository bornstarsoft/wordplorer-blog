Square Enix's recent comparison video showcasing Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade across multiple platforms, including the Switch 2, PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC, reveals an impressive feat: the Switch 2 version holds its own against more powerful consoles. The video, which features in-engine footage, highlights how the Switch 2 manages to deliver a visually appealing experience, even with its hardware limitations.

While the video runs at 30 frames per second, making frame rate comparisons difficult, early reports suggest that the Switch 2 version does not compromise on visual quality. Director Naoki Hamaguchi emphasized the importance of lighting in achieving high graphical fidelity, ensuring that character expressions and overall aesthetics remain intact. By optimizing other graphical elements, such as fog and post-processing effects, the team has crafted a version that stands out, even when compared to its more powerful counterparts.

As we look forward to the game's release on January 22, it raises an interesting question: can the Switch 2 redefine expectations for handheld gaming graphics? The anticipation builds as gamers eagerly await to see how this port performs in real-world scenarios.
