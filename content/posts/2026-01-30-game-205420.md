The latest State of the Game Industry survey by the Game Developers Conference reveals a striking trend: developers are twice as likely to express interest in creating games for the PS5 or Switch 2 compared to the Xbox Series X/S. With only 20% of surveyed developers favoring Xbox, this shift in interest highlights a significant change in the gaming landscape.

Among the 2,300 industry professionals surveyed, a whopping 80% indicated their preference for developing on PC, while 40% showed interest in the PS5 and 39% in the Switch 2. This stark contrast places Xbox closer in popularity to mobile platforms like Android and iOS rather than its current-gen competitors. As Xbox continues to position itself as a multiplatform entity, the question remains: will this trend impact the future of console gaming?

As developers weigh their options, factors such as audience reach and business model success are paramount. With major titles like Fable and Forza Horizon 6 set to release on multiple platforms, the gaming community is left to ponder the implications of these choices on the industry as a whole.
