Rare has officially announced that paid custom servers will be introduced to Sea of Thieves in early 2026. This exciting development was revealed during the game's first community direct, Custom Seas, and promises to enhance the gaming experience significantly. Players will gain access to exclusive tools, including a cinematic camera previously used for game trailers, although specific pricing details have yet to be disclosed. Its important to note that maintaining these servers will come at a cost, requiring a monthly fee.

In addition to the custom servers, Rare is also revamping the game's seasonal model. Starting with Season 17, each season will span three months and will be divided into three distinct phases: the first month will focus on revitalizing the sandbox gameplay, the second will introduce live events, and the final month will emphasize community engagement. This structured approach aims to reinvigorate player interest and participation in the game.

As Sea of Thieves continues to evolve, the introduction of paid custom servers and a refreshed seasonal model could reshape how players interact with the game. Will these changes be enough to reignite the community's passion for adventure on the high seas?
