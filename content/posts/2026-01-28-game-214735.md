Highguard, the newly launched free-to-play shooter, has made headlines by attracting nearly 100,000 concurrent players on its launch day. However, this impressive figure is tempered by a significant number of negative reviews, with over 13,000 players expressing dissatisfaction. This stark contrast raises questions about the game's design and player expectations.

Despite being the final announcement at The Game Awards, which typically highlights major franchises, Highguard's reception has been mixed. Many players have criticized the game's expansive map size, which they feel is ill-suited for the 3vs3 matchups. Developed by Wildlight Entertainment, a team with experience from franchises like Apex Legends and Call of Duty, the game had high expectations but seems to have missed the mark for a portion of its audience.

As the gaming community reflects on Highguard's launch, it will be interesting to see how the developers respond to player feedback and whether they can turn the tide of negative reviews into a more positive reception. Will future updates address the concerns raised by players, or will Highguard remain a cautionary tale of high expectations and mixed execution?
