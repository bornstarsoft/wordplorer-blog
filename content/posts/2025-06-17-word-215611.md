Amazon Prime Gaming is raising the stakes for its subscribers by adding six bonus games today, including the beloved **Tomb Raider I-III Remastered**. This exciting update comes just in time for Prime Day, allowing gamers to expand their libraries with a mix of classic and contemporary titles at no extra cost.

Starting today, June 17, at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET / 5 PM BST, Prime members can claim these games through the Amazon Prime Gaming page. The titles available for redemption include **Dungeon of the Endless: Definitive Edition**, **Saints Row 2**, **Saints Row IV: Re-Elected**, **Star Wars: Rebellion**, **TOEM**, and the remastered Tomb Raider trilogy. What's particularly appealing is that once claimed, these games remain in your library even if you decide to cancel your Amazon Prime subscription later.

This move not only enhances the value of an Amazon Prime membership but also reinforces the platform's commitment to providing engaging content for gamers. With a diverse selection of genres and gameplay styles, there's something for everyone to enjoy. Are you ready to dive into these new adventures and rediscover some classics?
