Fans have recently uncovered what appears to be a tantalizing hint at upcoming titles for Nintendo Switch Online's N64 catalog. A blurred segment in a May trailer has sparked speculation that beloved games such as Donkey Kong 64 and Super Smash Bros. might soon be added to the service. This discovery has ignited excitement among gamers who have long awaited these classic titles.

The blurred images, first pointed out by user @ImakuniVT, suggest that Nintendo may be preparing to expand its classic games library. While some believe these could be placeholder images, the potential inclusion of fan-favorite games like Forsaken 64 and Glover adds to the anticipation. Currently, the N64 catalog boasts over 30 titles, but the addition of these classics could significantly enhance the gaming experience for subscribers.

As Nintendo continues to evolve its offerings, the recent addition of GameCube titles to the service highlights the company's commitment to nostalgia and retro gaming. With the recent launch of Super Mario Strikers, fans are left wondering what other surprises Nintendo has in store. Will we soon see the return of more iconic N64 games? Only time will tell!
