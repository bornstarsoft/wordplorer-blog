The release of iRacing's NASCAR 25 Console Game marks a significant moment for NASCAR fans, especially with its extensive selection of base paint schemes. This game not only introduces a variety of drivers but also showcases the three NASCAR National Series and the debut of the ARCA Menards Series in the console gaming realm. For enthusiasts, this means a rich tapestry of designs and colors that celebrate the sport's heritage and its most iconic sponsors.

However, it's essential to note that some fan-favorite paint schemes and sponsors are conspicuously absent from NASCAR 25. Notable exclusions include cars associated with Monster Energy and alcoholic beverage sponsors, which may disappoint some players. Yet, the inclusion of brands like Red Bull, making its return to NASCAR gaming since 2011, adds a nostalgic touch that many will appreciate.

As the gaming landscape evolves, it will be interesting to see how iRacing continues to expand its offerings and whether future updates will address the exclusions that fans have pointed out. What are your thoughts on the current selection of paint schemes?
