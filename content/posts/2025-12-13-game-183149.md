Remedy Entertainment has just unveiled the highly-anticipated sequel, Control Resonant, at The Video Game Awards, and it promises to redefine the action-adventure RPG landscape. Set in a warped version of Manhattan, players will step into the shoes of Dylan Faden, who must confront a reality-bending cosmic threat while harnessing extraordinary powers. This sequel not only expands on the original's lore but also introduces a deep progression system that allows players to shape Dylan's abilities as they navigate a world where natural laws are upended.

What sets Control Resonant apart is its ambitious scale and the promise of a reality-warping playground filled with choice, power, and consequence. Creative Director Mikael Kasurinen emphasizes that newcomers can easily jump into this sequel, making it accessible while still offering a rich narrative experience. As players traverse perception-bending locations and face ever-changing threats, they will utilize Dylan's shapeshifting melee weapon, the Aberrant, to unleash elemental abilities and combat the cosmic forces at play.

Scheduled for release in 2026 on multiple platforms, including PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, Control Resonant is shaping up to be a must-play title for fans of the genre. Are you ready to dive into this expansive, supernatural adventure and explore the depths of Dylan Faden's troubled psyche?
