In a surprising twist that has sent shockwaves through the gaming community, Microsoft has announced that Obsidian Entertainment's highly anticipated sequel, The Outer Worlds 2, will be the first Xbox game to launch with a price tag of $80. This decision follows Nintendo's controversial pricing strategy with Mario Kart World, setting a new precedent in the gaming industry that has left many players questioning the value of their investments.

The announcement was made during the Xbox Games Showcase 2025, where a new gameplay trailer and a behind-the-scenes presentation were unveiled. While the game promises to deliver the same satirical commentary on capitalism and corporate greed that characterized its predecessor, the hefty price increase has sparked outrage among fans. Many took to social media and community forums to express their disbelief, with comments ranging from "The Price Is A Joke" to calls for a reevaluation of industry pricing standards.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, it raises an important question: will players accept this new pricing model, or will it lead to a backlash that could reshape the future of game development and marketing? Only time will tell how this bold move will impact The Outer Worlds 2 and the broader gaming community.
