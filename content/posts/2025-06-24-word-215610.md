A recently leaked development build of Sony Interactive Studios and Firewalk Studiosâ€™ now-canceled game, Concord, has caught the attention of the gaming community. Dated November 14, 2023, this pre-release version, known as FWChaos, surfaced online and has been confirmed as authentic by VGC, raising questions about the game's potential and the circumstances surrounding its cancellation.

Upon loading the game, players are greeted with a login screen that cannot be bypassed. However, an included .ini file allows access to a developer menu, leading to a Select Freegunner screen. Unfortunately, players are unable to proceed further as no Freegunners are available for selection. Despite the limitations, the build reveals intriguing elements such as a partially completed Galactic Guide, a Crew section detailing 16 playable characters, and various menus that hint at the game's expansive universe.

The leak not only provides a glimpse into what could have been a groundbreaking title for the PS5 but also raises discussions about the future of game development and the impact of leaks on the industry. As we look ahead, will this leak influence the way developers approach transparency and testing in their projects?
