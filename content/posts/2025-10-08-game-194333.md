In an inspiring display of community spirit, a charity quiz has successfully raised over 2 million for Marie Curie over the past 18 years. This annual event, organized by the charity's North East fundraising group, brings together teams from across the region for a fun-filled quiz night, all while supporting a crucial cause. The funds generated help provide essential care and support for individuals living with terminal illnesses and their families.

The quiz has become a beloved tradition in the local community, with teams eagerly returning each year to participate. Not only does it foster camaraderie and friendly competition, but it also highlights the importance of community involvement in charitable efforts. As organizers gear up for next years event, there is hope to surpass the previous fundraising achievements and continue making a significant impact on the lives of those in need.

As we look ahead, it raises an important question: how can we leverage technology and social media to further amplify such noble causes?
