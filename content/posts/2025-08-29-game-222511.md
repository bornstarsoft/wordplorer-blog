Capcom has officially put to rest the speculation surrounding its upcoming game, Pragmata, clarifying that it is not a secret Mega Man revival. This revelation comes from producer Naoto Oyama, who emphasized that Pragmata is a completely original title, distinct from the beloved Mega Man franchise. The excitement surrounding the game is palpable, especially given its intriguing sci-fi premise and the design of its robotic girl sidekick, Diana, which had drawn comparisons to Mega Man.

Since its announcement in June 2020, Pragmata has faced multiple delays, now set for release in 2026. Despite the long wait, early impressions from media previews suggest that the game is shaping up to be a polished and unique experience, leaving fans eager for more. Capcoms commitment to exploring new IPs while respecting its legacy franchises like Mega Man demonstrates a balanced approach to game development.

As we look forward to Pragmata's release, it raises the question: what innovative ideas will Capcom bring to the table in this new universe? Will it carve out its own identity while still paying homage to the classics?
