A new era of Pokmon gaming has arrived with the launch of Pokmon Friends, a free-to-play puzzle game that promises to engage fans on both mobile devices and Nintendo Switch. Released during the Pokmon Presents showcase in July 2025, this game features over 1,200 puzzles, making it a treasure trove for puzzle enthusiasts. While the mobile version offers a limited number of puzzles daily unless you opt for DLC packs, the Nintendo Switch version allows unlimited access right from the start with the purchase of a basic DLC pack.

What sets Pokmon Friends apart is not just its extensive puzzle library but also the unique customization options it offers. Players can decorate their in-game homes with plush toys and furniture, adding a personal touch to their gaming experience. This blend of puzzle-solving and home decoration could attract a diverse audience, from casual gamers to dedicated Pokmon fans.
