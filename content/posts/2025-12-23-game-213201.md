The Octopath Traveler series has reached an impressive milestone, surpassing 6 million units sold across its titles. This achievement, announced by Square Enix, reflects the growing popularity of the franchise, which includes the original Octopath Traveler, its sequel, and the latest addition, Octopath Traveler 0. The series has seen a significant increase in sales, especially after hitting the 5 million mark just a year ago.

The first game in the series has been particularly successful, with over 3 million units sold by September 2022, while Octopath Traveler II reached 1 million sales by June 2023. To celebrate this achievement, Square Enix is offering a 60% discount on the first two games during the holiday season, making it a perfect time for new players to dive into this captivating RPG universe.

As the franchise continues to grow, one can't help but wonder what the future holds for Octopath Traveler. Will we see more expansions or entirely new titles? The excitement among fans is palpable, and this milestone only adds to the anticipation for what's next in this beloved series.
