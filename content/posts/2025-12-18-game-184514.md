In recent years, a significant shift has occurred in the entertainment habits of Koreans, with video viewing time on the rise and gaming time on the decline. According to a report from the Ministry of Science and ICT, Koreans now spend an average of 1 hour and 54 minutes daily watching videos, a notable increase from the previous year. In contrast, the average gaming time has decreased to 1 hour and 25 minutes per day.

This trend can largely be attributed to the explosive growth of online video platforms like YouTube and Netflix, which provide an extensive array of content that appeals to diverse audiences. As these platforms become more integrated into daily life, they are reshaping how entertainment is consumed, often requiring less commitment than traditional gaming experiences that demand more time and focus.

As we look to the future, it will be interesting to see how this shift impacts the gaming industry and whether developers will adapt to the changing preferences of their audience. Will gaming find new ways to engage users, or will video streaming continue to dominate the entertainment landscape?
