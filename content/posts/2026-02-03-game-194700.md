In a groundbreaking move, Netflix is set to redefine football gaming with its upcoming FIFA title, led by industry veteran Julien Merceron, the former chief technology officer at Konami. With a vision to reimagine the FIFA series from the ground up, Merceron's expertise in developing the Fox Engine for iconic games like Metal Gear Solid 5 and Pro Evolution Soccer positions him perfectly to create a fresh experience for fans.

The new FIFA game, scheduled for release in time for the 2026 World Cup, will leverage Netflix's streaming capabilities, allowing players to use their mobile devices as controllers. This innovative approach not only enhances accessibility but also aligns with the evolving landscape of gaming, where traditional consoles are increasingly complemented by cloud-based solutions.

As Merceron and his team at Delphi Interactive work alongside Refactor Games, they aim to capture the essence of what made football games enjoyable in the past while ensuring that the gameplay remains engaging for a broader audience. With a focus on fun and feel, this project could signal a significant shift in how we experience sports gaming in the future. Will this be the game that brings football fans back to their consoles, or will it set a new standard for interactive entertainment?
