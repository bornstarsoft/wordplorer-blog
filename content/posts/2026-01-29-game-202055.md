Indie game development team Team Afternoon is set to release their innovative game, "Don't You Trust Me?" on February 6, 2026. This free-to-play title on Steam presents a unique twist on traditional gaming by placing players in the role of a video editor tasked with crafting a "fake clear video" of a failed dungeon raid, all within a nostalgic Windows 98 aesthetic.

The core gameplay revolves around precise timeline editing, where players must analyze enemy attack patterns and strategically arrange clips to create a flawless action sequence. The developers emphasize that every frame counts, stating, "Not a single frame of compromise is acceptable when it comes to creating miracles." This attention to detail not only enhances the gaming experience but also challenges players to think creatively about storytelling through gameplay.

As players navigate the ironic narrative of a hero's journey juxtaposed with the chaotic reality of their failures, they are invited to reflect on the nature of success and perception in gaming. With its blend of turn-based strategy, puzzle, and simulation genres, "Don't You Trust Me?" promises to be a refreshing addition to the indie game landscape. Will you be ready to create your own perfect victory on February 6?
